# Package up all the xCAT open source dependencies, setting up yum repos and
# also tar it all up.  This assumes that individual rpms have already been built for
# all relevant architectures from the src & spec files in svn.

# When running this script to package xcat-dep:
#  - You need to install gsa-client on the build machine.
#  - You probably want to put root's pub key from the build machine onto sourceforge for
#    the upload user listed below, so you don't have to keep entering pw's.  You can do this
#    at https://sourceforge.net/account/ssh
#  - Also make sure createrepo is installed on the build machine

# Usage:  builddep.sh [attr=value attr=value ...]
#		DESTDIR=<dir> - the dir to place the dep tarball in.  The default is ../../../xcat-dep, relative
#					to where this script is located.
# 		UP=0 or UP=1 - override the default upload behavior 

# you can change this if you need to
