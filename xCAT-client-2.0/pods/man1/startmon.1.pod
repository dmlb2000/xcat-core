=head1 NAME
 
B<startmon> - Starts a plug-in module to monitor the xCAT cluster.

  
 
=head1 SYNOPSIS
 
I<startmon [-h| --help]>

I<startmon  [-v| --version]>


I<startmon I<name> [-n|--nodestatmon]>


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is used to register a monitoring plug-in module and invoke it to monitor the xCAT cluster. A monitoring plug-in module acts as a bridge that connects a 3rd party monitoring software and the xCAT cluster. The plug-in module will be registered in the xCAT I<monitoring> database table. A registered plug-in module is automatically started by the I<xcatd>.  
       

=head1 Parameters

I<name> is the name of the monitoring plug-in module. For example, if the the I<name> is called I<xxx>, then the actual file name that the xcatd looks for is I</opt/xcat/lib/perl/xCAT_monitoring/xxx.pm>.  

=head1 OPTIONS


B<-n | -nodestatmon>   Indicate that this monitoring plug-in will be used for feeding the node liveness status to the xCAT I<nodelist> table. 

B<-h | -help>          Display usage message.

B<-v | -version >      Command Version. 

B<-V | -verbose>       Verbose output. 


=head1 RETURN VALUE

0 The command completed successfully.

1 An error has occurred.

=head1 EXAMPLES

1. To start gangliamon plug-in module (which interacts with Ganglia monitoring software) to monitor the xCAT cluster, enter:

  startmon gangliamon

2. To start rmcmon plug-in module (which interacts with IBM's RSCT monitoring software) to monitor the xCAT cluster and have it feed the node liveness status to xCAT's I<nodelist> table, enter:

  startmon rmcmon -n
