I<startmon I<name>[,I<name>...]>


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is used to manually start a list of monitoring plug-in modules to monitor the xCAT cluster.  A monitoring plug-in module acts as a bridge that connects a 3rd party monitoring software and the xCAT cluster. The plug-in modules must have been registered in the xCAT I<monitoring> database table. A registered plug-in module is usually automatically started by xCAT when xcatd starts or when it is first registered.  
This command is used only when the user stopped it manually using the I<stopmon> command and would like to restart it again.
