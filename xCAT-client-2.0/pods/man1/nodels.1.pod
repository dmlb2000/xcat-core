=head1 NAME

B<nodels> - lists the nodes in the noderange.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<nodels> [I<noderange>] [I<table.attribute> | I<shortname>] I<...>

B<nodels> [B<-?> | B<-h> | B<--help>]

B<nodels> [B<-v> | B<--version>]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The nodels command lists the nodes specified in the node range. If no noderange is provided, then all nodes are listed.

Additional attributes of the nodes will also be displayed if the table names and attribute names
are specified after the noderange in the form:  I<table.attribute> .  A few shortcut names can
also be used as aliases to common attributes:

=over 10

=item I<groups>

nodelist.groups

=item I<tags>

nodelist.groups

=item I<mgt>

nodehm.mgt

=item I<switch>

switch.switch

=back

The nodels command with a specific node and one or more table.attribute parameters is a good substitute
for grep'ing through the tab files, like was done in xCAT 1.x.  This is because nodels will translate
any regular expression rows in the tables into their meaning for the specified node.  The tab* commands
will not do this, instead they will just display the single regular expression row.
