=head1 NAME
 
B<mkvm> - Creates HMC- and IVM-managed partitions.  
 
=head1 SYNOPSIS
 
I<mkvm [-h| --help]>

I<mkvm  [-v| --version]>

I<mkvm [-V| --verbose] singlenode -i id -n name>

I<mkvm [-V| --verbose] src_fsp -c dest_fsp>


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The mkvm command creates a new partition with the same profile/resources as the partition specified by singlenode. The -i and -n flags specify the numeric partition number and name of the newly created partition, respectively. The second form of this command duplicates all the partitions associated with src_fsp to dest_fsp. Note that src_dest and dest_fsp must be associated with the same HMC. Newly created partitions are automatically added to the xCAT database.
