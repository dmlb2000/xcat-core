=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is used to change xCAT object definitions which are stored in the xCAT database.  The default is to replace any existing attribute value with the one specified on the command line. The command will also create a new definition if one doesn't exist.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<attr=val [attr=val ...]>  Specifies one or more "attribute equals value" pairs, separated by spaces. Attr=val pairs must be specified last on the command line. Use the help option to get a list of valid attributes for each object type. 

B<-h |--help>            Display usage message.

B<-m |--minus>           If the value of the attribute is a list then this option may be used to remove one or more items from the list.

B<-o object-names>       A set of comma delimited object names.

B<-p |--plus>            This option will add the specified values to the existing value of the attribute.  It will create a comma-separated list of values.

B<-t object-types>       A set of comma delimited object types.  Use the help option to get a list of valid object types.

B<-V |--verbose>         Verbose mode.
