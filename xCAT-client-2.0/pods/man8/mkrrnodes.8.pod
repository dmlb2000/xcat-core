=head1 NAME

B<mkrrnodes> - Sample tool for adding or deleting many nodes in the xCAT cluster database.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<mkrrnodes> [B<-d> ]| [B<-C> I<a|b|,...,r>]  B<-R> I<startrange,endrange>


B<mkrrnodes> [B<-h> | B<--help>]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<mkrrnodes> command is a sample tool that adds or deletes (-d) nodes according to a specific
naming convention.  You can input the connected unit name (CU, a subset of the cluster, usually in its own
subnet and managed by an xCAT service node) using the -C flag, and you can input the start and end
range using the -R flag. It will also automatically define required nodegroups.

In this example tool, the node names will have the format:

B<rr>I<x048y>

where:
 x is a-z, indicating the CU name
 048 is the node number within that CU
 y is a-c, indicating which of 3 blades within the "triblade" group it is
