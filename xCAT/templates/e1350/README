This set of templates is based on the address scheme given:
ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/eserver/xseries/1350FS_0507.pdf
To load:
for i in *.csv; do tabload $i; done

For what any of the tags used in this readme do, grep <tagname> *.csv and you will see what settings it
provides interpretations for.


After which, the various provided tags can be used to add nodes and automatically follow thing.
For example, to add 2048 IPMI rackmount nodes which happen to start at the first U of the first rack,
with each rack having a 1U switch and 41 servers plugged into that switch, numbered 1-41 in order,
intended to have the 'compute' profile, named node1-node0248, and have a convenience group called 'all':
nodeadd node1-node2048 tags=41nodeperrack,41perswitch,ipmi,compute,all

After that, a lot of things will be populated according to that scheme:
nodels node1235 nodepos.u nodepos.rack switch.switch switch.port ipmi.bmc hosts.ip
node1235: hosts.ip: 172.20.131.5
node1235: nodepos.u: 5
node1235: nodepos.rack: 31
node1235: switch.switch: switch31
node1235: switch.port: 5
node1235: ipmi.bmc: bmc1235

Note the hosts table is only used if you use the makehosts command.

An example with blades, 56 to a rack and padding out to four digits:
nodeadd node0001-node2048 tags=blade,compute,all,56nodeperrack


And if wanting to use makehosts for non-server equipment, nodeadd can help for that as well with these templates:
(Supplementing the previous rackmount example)
nodeadd switch1-switch50 tags=switch
nodeadd bmc1-bmc2048 tags=41bmcperrack
makehosts switch,41bmcperrack

(And to make hosts file entries for 147 AMMs for the 2048 blades above)
nodeadd amm1-amm147 tags=amm
makehosts amm
