This is at this point essentially a demo of xCAT 2.0 concepts.

Currently, all it can do is the set of out-of-band management of IPMI systems.

To see how it works:
./rpminstallperlxcat
./rpminstallserver
(at this point it will list failed dependencies probably, have fun filling those,
SLES10 includes the SSL one, and SLES10 sdk has perl-XML-Simple,
the details of making these deps easy is a TODO for 1.3 release)
./rpminstallclient


Now that it is installed, setup of the security for 1.2 like operation:
/usr/share/xcat/scripts/setup-xcat-ca.sh
(put whatever common name you want)
/usr/share/xcat/scripts/setup-server-cert.sh
(name something for your server, say y twice)
/usr/share/xcat/scripts/setup-local-client.sh
(use the name root for now)

chtab key=xcatdport site.value=3002 (using 3002 so you can use it on an xcat 1.2 server without worry)

(now assuming setup for a node called node1 with a bmc called node1-bmc)
chtab node=node1 nodelist.groups=ipmi
chtab node=ipmi nodehm.mgt=ipmi ipmi.bmc='/\z/-bmc/'

(start xcatd)
xcatd & (the warnings are not actually useful to correct now, so don't worry) 

export XCATHOST=localhost:3002
testclient power node1 stat

(should work, number of commands will work, obviously the name indicates I haven't bother with the shorter
rpower/rinv/rvitals names yet, but it will come, also obviously since the client can do everything,
it will be busybox like most likely)

To add another node2 with same name scheme as node1:
chtab node=node2 nodelist.groups=ipmi
(can immediately start rpowering)
