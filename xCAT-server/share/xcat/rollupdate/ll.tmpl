# Sample job command template file used to generate cluster rolling update
# job command files that will be used to create reservations in LoadLeveler.
# xCAT will substitute the following when creating the LL job command files:
#  [[NODESET]]   -  the update group name for the nodes in this reservation
#  [[JOBDIR]]    -  the directory specified in the rollupdate input stanza
#                   jobdir entry
#  [[LLHOSTFILE]] - the file generated by the xCAT rollupdate command that
#                   contains the list of LL machines in this update group
#                   that were available at the time the command was run.
#  [[MUTEXRESOURCES]] - The list of LL resources created by xCAT to handle
#                   mutual exclusion and maxupdates
#
# @ job_name = rollupdate_[[NODESET]]
# @ job_type = parallel
# @ node_usage = not_shared
# @ restart = no
# @ error   = [[JOBDIR]]/rollupdate_[[NODESET]].$(Host).$(Cluster).$(Process).err
# @ output  = [[JOBDIR]]/rollupdate_[[NODESET]].$(Host).$(Cluster).$(Process).out
