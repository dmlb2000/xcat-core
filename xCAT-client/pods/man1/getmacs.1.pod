=head1 EXAMPLES

1. To retrieve the MAC address for the HMC-managed partition lpar4 and write the first adapter MAC to the xCAT database, enter:

Output is similar to:

lpar4: 

#Type  Location Code   MAC Address      Full Path Name  Ping Result

ent U9133.55A.10B7D1G-V12-C4-T1 8e:e2:24:5c:f0:04 /vdevice/l-lan@30000004  virtual



2. To retrieve the MAC address for the HMC-managed partition lpar4 and display the result only, enter: 

I<getmacs lpar4 -d> 

Output is similar to:

lpar4: 

#Type  Location Code   MAC Address      Full Path Name  Ping Result

ent U9133.55A.10B7D1G-V12-C4-T1 8ee2245cf004 /vdevice/l-lan@30000004 virtual



3. To retrieve the MAC address while performing a ping test for the HMC-managed partition lpar4 and display the result only, enter: 

I<getmacs lpar4 -d -S 9.3.6.49 -G 9.3.6.1 -C 9.3.6.234>

#Type  Location Code   MAC Address      Full Path Name  Ping Result

ent U9133.55A.10B7D1G-V12-C4-T1 8e:e2:24:5c:f0:04 /vdevice/l-lan@30000004 successful virtual
