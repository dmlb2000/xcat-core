B<packimage> - Packs the stateless image from the chroot file system.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

I<packimage [-h| --help]>

I<packimage  [-v| --version]>


I<packimage [-o OS] [ -p profile] [-a architecture] [-m method]>


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Packs the stateless image from the chroot file system into a file system to be
sent to the node for a diskless install.
The install dir is setup by using "installdir" attribute set in the site table.
The nodetype table "profile" attribute for the node should reflect the profile of the install image.

This uses the package information from the /opt/xcat/share/xcat/netboot/[os] directory files for the profile input.
