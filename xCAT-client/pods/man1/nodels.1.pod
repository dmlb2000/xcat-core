=head1 NAME

B<nodels> - lists the nodes, and their attributes, from the xCAT database.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<nodels> [I<noderange>] [B<-H> | B<--with-fieldname>] [I<table.column> | I<shortname>] [I<...>]

B<nodels> [I<noderange>] [B<-H> | B<--with-fieldname>] [I<table>]

B<nodels> [B<-?> | B<-h> | B<--help> | B<-v> | B<--version>]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<nodels> command lists the nodes specified in the node range. If no noderange is provided, then all nodes are listed.

Additional attributes of the nodes will also be displayed if the table names and attribute names
are specified after the noderange in the form:  I<table.column> .  A few shortcut names can
also be used as aliases to common attributes:

=over 15

=item B<groups>

nodelist.groups

=item B<tags>

nodelist.groups

=item B<mgt>

nodehm.mgt

=item B<switch>

switch.switch

=back

The B<nodels> command with a specific node and one or more table.attribute parameters is a good substitute
for grep'ing through the tab files, as was typically done in xCAT 1.x.  This is because nodels will translate
any regular expression rows in the tables into their meaning for the specified node.  The tab* commands
will not do this, instead they will just display the regular expression row verbatim.

   rra001a: noderes.servicenode: rra000
   rra001a: noderes.node: rra001a


=item 3.

To list nodes in node group ppc, enter:

 nodels ppc

Output is similar to:

   ppcnode1
   ppcnode2
   ppcnode3

=item 4.

To list the groups each node is part of:

 nodels all groups

Output is similar to:

   node1: groups: all
   node2: groups: all,storage
   node3: groups: all,blade

=item 5.

To list the groups each node is part of:

 nodels all nodehm.power

Output is similar to:

   node1: nodehm.power: blade
   node2: nodehm.power: ipmi
