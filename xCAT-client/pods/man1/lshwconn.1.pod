1 An error has occurred.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 3

=item 1.

To display connection status for all FSP nodes in node group fsp:

 lshwconn fsp

Output is similar to:

 cec1: ipaddr=192.168.200.245,alt_ipaddr=unavailable,state=Connected
 cec2: Connection not found

=item 2.

To display connection status for BPA node frame1:

 lshwconn frame1

Output is similar to:

 frame1: side=a,ipaddr=192.168.200.247,alt_ipaddr=unavailable,state=Connected
 frame1: side=b,ipaddr=192.168.200.248,alt_ipaddr=unavailable,state=Connected

=item 3.

To display connection status for all FSP nodes in node group fsp to hardware server, and using lpar tooltype:

 lshwconn fsp -T lpar

Output is similar to:

 cec1: sp=primary,ipadd=40.3.7.1,alt_ipadd=unavailable,state=LINE UP
 cec2: Connection not found
