=head1 OPTIONS

=over 5

=item B<-h|--help>

Display usage message.

=item B<-V|--verbose>

Verbose output.

=item B<-T>

1 An error has occurred.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 3

=item 1.

To display connection status for all CEC nodes in node group CEC:

 lshwconn cec

Output is similar to:

 cec1: sp=primary,ipadd=40.17.1.1,alt_ipadd=41.17.1.1,state=LINE UP
 cec1: sp=secondary,ipadd=40.17.1.2,alt_ipadd=41.17.1.2,state=LINE UP
 cec2: sp=primary,ipadd=40.17.2.1,alt_ipadd=41.17.2.1,state=LINE UP
 cec2: 40.17.2.2: No connection information found for hardware control point "40.17.2.2", please create the connection for this hardware control point firstly.
 cec2: 41.17.2.2: No connection information found for hardware control point "41.17.2.2", please create the connection for this hardware control point firstly.

=item 2.

To display connection status for Frame node frame1:

 lshwconn frame1

Output is similar to:

 frame1: sp=primary,ipadd=192.168.200.1,alt_ipadd=192.168.201.1,state=LINE UP 
 frame1: sp=secondary,ipadd=192.168.200.2,alt_ipadd=192.168.201.2,state=LINE UP 

=item 3.

To display connection status for all CEC nodes in node group CEC to hardware server, and using lpar tooltype:

 lshwconn cec -T lpar

Output is similar to:

 cec1: sp=primary,ipadd=40.3.7.1,alt_ipadd=unavailable,state=LINE UP
 cec2: Connection not found
