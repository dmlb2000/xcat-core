B<updatenode> - Update nodes in an xCAT cluster environment.


=head1 B<SYNOPSIS>

B<updatenode> [-h|--help|-v|--version]

B<updatenode> <noderange> [-V|--verbose] [-F|--sync] [-S|--sw] 
[-P|--scripts [script1,script2...]] 

B<updatenode> <noderange> [-V|--verbose] [script1,script2...]


=head1 B<DESCRIPTION>

The updatenode command is run on the xCAT management node and can be used
to perform the following node updates:
    1) Distribute and synchronize files.  
    2) Install or update software on diskfull nodes.
    3) Run postscripts.

The default behavior of updatenode will be to attempt to perform all three
types of updates.  If you wish to limit updatenode to one or two specific 
actions you can use combinations of the "-S", "-P", and "-F" flags.

For example, If you just want to synchronize configuration file you could
specify the "-F" flag.   If you want to synchronize files and update 
software you would specify the "-F" and "-S" flags. See the descriptions 
of these flags and examples below.

Note: In a large cluster environment the updating of nodes in an ad hoc 
manner can quickly get out of hand, leaving the system administrator with 
a very confusing environment to deal with. The updatenode command is 
designed to encourage users to handle cluster updates in a manner that 
is recorded and easily repeatable.  If you are not concerned about the 
structure the updatenode command provides you can use other xCAT support
such as xdsh and xdcp to accomplish these update tasks.

=head2 B<To distribute and synchronize files>

    The basic process for distributing and synchronizing nodes is:
        - Create a synclist file.
        - Indicate the location of the synclist file.
        - Run the updatenode command to update the nodes.

    Files may be distributed and synchronized for both diskless and 
    diskfull nodes.  However, since some filesystems are mounted 
    read-only on AIX diskless nodes it my not be possible to update all 
    files on AIX systems.  For example, any files under /usr on AIX 
    diskless nodes cannot be updated. 
	
    More details for synchronization file is described "Sync-File HowTo".

    Create the synclist file.

        The synclist file contains the configuration entries that specify 
        where the files should be synced to. In the synclist file, each 
        line is an entry which describes the location of the source files 
        and the destination location for the files on the target node. 

        The basic entry format looks like following:
            path_of_src_file1  -> path_of_dst_file1
            path_of_src_file1  path_of_src_file2 ... -> 
                path_of_dst_directory

        The path_of_src_file* should be the full path of the source file 
        on the Management Node.
        The path_of_dst_file* should be the full path of the destination 
        file on target node.
        The path_of_dst_directory should be the full path of the destina-
        tion directory.
        Since the synclist file is for common purpose, the target node 
        need not be configured in it, it will be the noderange input to 
        updatenode. 

        The following formats are supported:
        1) sync file /etc/file1 to the directory /etc on the node with 
        the same file name
            /etc/file1 -> /etc/file1
        2) sync file /etc/file2 to the file /etc/file3 on the node (with 
        different file name)
            /etc/file2 -> /etc/file3
        3) sync file /etc/file2 to the file /etc/tmp/file3 on the node (with 
        different file name, different directory) If the directory does not
        exist, it will be created. 
            /etc/file2 -> /etc/tmp/file3
        4) sync the multiple files /etc/file1, /etc/file2,  /etc/file3, 
        ... to the directory /tmp/etc (/tmp/etc must be a directory when 
        multiple files are sync'd at one time).  If the directory does 
        not exist, xdcp will create it. 
            /etc/file1 /etc/file2 /etc/file3 -> /tmp/etc



    Indicate the location of the synclist file.

        For Linux nodes.

            The path of the synclist should be following format:
              /install/custom/<inst_type>/<distro>/<profile>.<os>.<arch>.
                synclist
                  <inst_type>: "install", "netboot"
                  <distro>: "rh", "centos", "fedora", "sles"
                  <profile>,<os> and <arch> are what you set for the node


        For AIX nodes.

            Add a full path of the synclist file to the "synclists" 
            attribute base on the xCAT osimage name used by the node 
            in the osimage table. 

              chdef -t osimage -o myosimage synclists=/mydir/syncfile1

    Run updatenode to synchronize the files.
        
        updatenode <noderange> -F


=head2 B<To install or update software (only available on Linux Nodes)>

    The basic process for updating software on diskfull nodes is:
        - Copy the software to a mountable directory.
        - Create a record of what software to install.
        - Run the updatenode command to update the nodes.

    On Linux systems
   
        To install additional software for Linux diskfull nodes, 
    
        First, copy the extra rpms you are going to add on to 
        /install/post/otherpkgs/<os>/<arch>/* directory where <os> and 
        <arch> are defined in the <nodetype> table.
    
        Second, add rpm names (without version number) into
    
            /install/custom/install/<ostype>/profile.otherpkgs.pkglist
    
        where <profile> is defined in the <nodetype> table. <ostype>
        is the operating system name without the version number.
        The following os types are recognized by xCAT.
   
            centos
            fedora
            rh
            sles
            windows
   
        Third, type:
   
            updatenode <noderange> -S


=head2 B<To run postscripts>
    
    The scripts must be copied to the /install/postscripts 
    directory on the xCAT management node. (Make sure they are 
    executable.)

    To run scripts on a node you must either specify them on the 
    command line or you must add them to the "postscripts" attribute 
    for the node.  

    To set the postscripts attribute of the node (or group) 
    definition you can use the xCAT chdef command. Set the value to 
    be a comma separated list of the scripts that you want to be 
    executed on the nodes. The order of the scripts in the list 
    determines the order in which they will be run.  You could also set
    the postscripts value by directly editing the xCAT "postscripts" 
    database table using the xCAT tabedit command.

    Scripts may be run on both diskless and diskfull nodes.

    To run all the customization scripts that have been designated 
    for the nodes, (in the "postscripts" attribute), type:
        updatenode <noderange> -P

    To run the "syslog" script for the nodes, type:
        updatenode <noderange> -P syslog

    To run  a list of scripts, type:
        updatenode <noderange> -P script1,script2

    The flag '-P' is omitted when only postscripts parameters are
    specified.

    Note: script1,script2 may or may not be designated as a scripts to 
    automatically run on the node. However, if you want script1 and 
    script2 get invoked next time the nodes are deployed then make sure 
    to add them to the "postscripts" values for the nodes. 


=head1 B<PARAMETERS>

1 An error has occurred.


=head1 B<EXAMPLES>

1)  To perform all updatenode features for the Linux nodes in the group
"compute".
    updatenode compute

The command will: run any scripts listed in the nodes "postscripts" 
attribute, install or update any software indicated in the 
/install/custom/install/<ostype>/profile.otherpkgs.pkglist (refer to the 
B<To install or update software part>), synchronize any files indicated by 
the synclist files specified in the osimage "synclists" attribute.

2)  To perform a software update and file synchronization only on the node
"clstrn01".
    updatenode clstrn01 -F -P

3) To run the postscripts which indicated in the postscripts attribute on 
the node "clstrn01".
    updatenode  clstrn01 -P

4) To run the postscripts script1 and script2 on the node "clstrn01". 
Copy these scripts to the /install/postscripts first.
    updatenode clstrn01 -P script1,script2
Since flag '-P' is omitted when only postscripts parameters are specified, 
the following command line are equivalent.
    updatenode clstrn01 script1,script2

5) To synchronize the files on the node "clstrn01". Prepare the synclist file. 
For AIX node, set the full path of synclist in  the osimage table synclists 
attribute. For Linux node, put the synclist file into the location: 
/install/custom/<inst_type>/<distro>/<profile>.<os>.<arch>.synclist
    updatenode  clstrn01 -F

6) To perform the software update on the Linux node "clstrn01". Copy the extra 
rpm into the /install/post/otherpkgs/<os>/<arch>/* and add the rpm names into 
the /install/custom/install/<ostype>/profile.otherpkgs.pkglist
