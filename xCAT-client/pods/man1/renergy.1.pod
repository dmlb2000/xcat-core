=head1 B<DESCRIPTION>

This B<renergy> command can be used to manage the energy consumption of
IBM servers which support IBM EnergyScale technology. Through this command, 
user can query and set the power saving and power capping status, also can 
query the average consumed energy, the ambient and exhaust temperature, 
the processor frequency for a server.

B<renergy> command supports IBM POWER6 and POWER7 rack-mounted servers 
(system P CEC node),  blade management module node, blade server node. 
For rack-mounted servers, following specific hardware types are supported:
I<8203-E4A>, I<8204-E8A>, I<9125-F2A>, I<8233-E8B>, I<8236-E8C>.

The parameter I<noderange> needs to be specified for B<renergy> command to 
get the target server. The I<noderange> should be a list of CEC node names, blade 
management module node names or blade server node names. Lpar name
is not acceptable here.

B<renergy> command can accept multiple of energy attributes to query or one of energy 
attribute to set. If only the attribute name is specified, without the '=', B<renergy> 
gets and displays the current value. Otherwise, if specifying the attribute with '=' like 
'savingstatus=on', B<renergy> will set the attribute savingstatus to value 'on'. 

The attributes listed in the B<SYNOPSIS> section are which ones can be handled by 
B<renergy> command. But for each specific type of server, there are some attributes that
are not supported. If user specifies an attribute which does not be supported by certain
server, the return value of this attribute will be 'na'.

The supported attributes for each specific hardware types are listed as follow:

=over 2

B<8203-E4A>, B<8204-E8A> 

=over 4

Supported attributes: 

B<Query>: savingstatus,cappingstatus,cappingmin,cappingmax,
cappingvalue,cappingsoftmin,averageAC,averageDC,ambienttemp,
exhausttemp,CPUspeed

B<Set>:   savingstatus,cappingstatus,cappingwatt,cappingperc

Note:
For system P CEC nodes, each query operation for attribute CPUspeed, averageAC 
or averageDC needs about 30 seconds to complete. The query for others attributes
will get response immediately.


=head1 B<PREREQUISITE>

For the system P CEC nodes, B<renergy> command depends 
on the Energy Management Plugin for xCAT B<xCAT-cimclient> to 
communicate with server. Then, before running the B<renergy> command, to
check whether the B<xCAT-cimclient> package has been installed. 

B<xCAT-cimclient> can be downloaded from IBM web site: 
http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/xcat/energy.html

Note: For 9125-F2A server, the value of attribute 
averageAC is the aggregate for all of the servers in a rack.

Note: For Blade Center, the value of attribute 
averageAC is the total AC power being consumed by all modules
 in the chassis. It also includes power consumed by the Chassis 
Cooling Devices for BCH chassis.

=item B<averageDC>

Query the average power consumed (Output). (Unit is watt)

=item B<capability>

to throttle.

enabled, but capping disabled.

dynamicPowerMeasurement1: the module with power meter capability, measurement 
enabled, phase 1 only

dynamicPowerMeasurement2: the module with power meter capability, measurement 
enabled, phase 2 or higher

dynamicPowerMeasurementWithPowerCapping: the module with power meter capability, 
both measurement and capping enabled, phase 2 or higher

=item B<cappingmaxmin>

Query the maximum and minimum of power capping value 
which can be set for a CEC or blade server. (Unit is watt) 

=item B<cappingperc>=B<percentage>

Set the power capping value base on the percentage of 
the max-min of capping value which getting from 
I<cappingmaxmim> attribute. The valid value must be 
from 0 to 100.

=item B<cappingsoftmin>

Query the minimum value that can be assigned to power 
capping without guaranteed enforceability. (Unit is watt)

=item B<cappingstatus>

Query the power capping status. The result should be 'on' 
or 'off'.

=item B<cappingstatus>={B<on> | B<off>}

Set the power capping status. The value must be 'on' 
or 'off'. This is the switch to turn on or turn off the 
power capping function.

=item B<cappingvalue>

=item B<dsavingstatus>

Query the dynamic power saving status. The result should 
be 'on-norm', 'on-maxp'  or 'off'. 

If turning on the dynamic power saving, the processor

the core utilization. It supports two modes for turn on state: 

I<on-norm> - means normal, the processor frequency cannot 
exceed the nominal value; 

I<on-maxp> - means maximum performance, the processor 
frequency can exceed the nominal value.
