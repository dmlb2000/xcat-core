=head1 NAME

B<swapnodes> - swap the location info in the db between 2 nodes. If swapping within a cec, it will assign the IO adapters that were assigned to the defective node to the available node. 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<swapnodes> [B<-h>| B<--help>]

B<swapnodes> B<-c> current_node B<-f> fip_node

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is only for P7 IH using Direct FSP Management. It's used to swap the location info in the db between 2 nodes. If swapping within a cec, it will assign the IO adapters that were assigned to the defective node to the available node. Originally, the current_node is a defective non-compute node, and fip_node is a avaible compute node. After the swapping, the current_node will be a available node.
