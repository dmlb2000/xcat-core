=head1 NAME

B<rmhwconn> - Use this command to remove connections from FSP and BPA nodes to HMC nodes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<rmhwconn> [B<-h>| B<--help>]

B<rmhwconn> [B<-v>| B<--version>]

=head2 PPC (with HMC) specific:

B<rmhwconn> [B<-V>| B<--verbose>] noderange

=head2 PPC (without HMC, using FSPAPI) specific:

B<rmhwconn> noderange B<-T tooltype>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For PPC (with HMC) specific:

This command is used to disconnect FSP and BPA nodes from HMC nodes, according to the connection information defined in ppc talbe in xCAT DB. 

Note: If a CEC (FSP node represents) belongs to a frame with a BPA installed, this CEC cannot be disconnected individually. Instead, the whole frame (BPA node represents) should be disconnected.

For PPC (without HMC, using FSPAPI) specific:

It's used to disconnection FSP and BPA nodes from hardware server.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 5

=item B<-h|--help>

Display usage message.

=item B<-V|--verbose>

Verbose output.

=item B<-T>

The tooltype is used to communicate to the FSP/BPA. The value could be lpar or fnm. The tooltype value lpar is for xCAT and fnm is for CNM.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

0 The command completed successfully.

1 An error has occurred.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 3

=item 1.

To disconnect all FSP nodes in node group fsp from their HMC nodes:

 rmhwconn fsp

=item 2.

To remove the connection for BPA node frame1:

 rmhwconn frame1

=item 3.

To disconnect all FSP nodes in node group fsp from their related hardware serveri, using lpar tooltype:
 
 rmhwconn fsp -T lpar

(The XCATROOT environment variable is set when xCAT is installed. The
default value is "/opt/xcat".)
