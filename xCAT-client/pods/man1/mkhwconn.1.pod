=head1 NAME

B<mkhwconn> - Sets up connections for FSP and BPA nodes to HMC nodes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<mkhwconn> [B<-h>| B<--help>]

B<mkhwconn> [B<-v>| B<--version>]

B<mkhwconn> [B<-V>| B<--verbose>] noderange B<-t>

B<mkhwconn> [B<-V>| B<--verbose>] noderange B<-H> hmc [B<-P> passwd]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is used to set up connections for FSP and BPA nodes to HMC nodes. (If the connection already exists, it will not break it.)
This command is useful when you have multiple HMCs, each of which will manage a subset of the FSPs/BPAs.  Use B<mkhwconn> to tell
each HMC which FSPs/BPAs it should manage.  When using this, you should turn off the self-discovery on each HMC.  You also need
to put all the HMCs and all the BPAs on a single flat service network.

When -t is specified, this command reads the connection information from the xCAT ppc table (e.g. the parent attribute), and read the user/password from the ppcdirect table. Then this command will assign FSP nodes and BPA nodes to HMC nodes. 

When -H is specified, this command gets the connection information from command line arguments. If -P is not specified, the default password for FSP and BPA nodes is used.

In any case, before running this command, the FSP and BPA nodes need be defined with correct nodetype.nodetype value (fsp or bpa) and nodehm.mgt value (hmc).

Note: If a CEC (FSP) belongs to a frame, which has a BPA installed, this CEC should not be assigned to an HMC individually. Instead, the whole frame (BPA) should be assigned to the HMC.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 5

=item B<-h|--help>

Display usage message.

=item B<-t>

Read connection information from xCAT DB (ppc and ppcdirect tables).  Use this option if you need to connect multiple FSPs/BPAs
to multiple HMCs in a single command.

=item B<-H>

The HMC node name. Only one HMC nodes can be specified by this flag. To setup connection for multiple HMC nodes, use flag -t.

=item B<-P>

The password of user 'admin' on FSP and BPA nodes. This flag is optional. Default password is 'admin'.

=item B<-V|--verbose>

Verbose output.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

0 The command completed successfully.

1 An error has occurred.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 3

=item 1.

To setup the connection for all FSP nodes in node group fsp, according to the definition in xCAT DB:

 mkhwconn fsp -t

=item 2.

To setup the connection for BPA nodes in node group frame_grp1 to HMC node hmc1, with password 'abc123':

 mkhwconn frame_grp1 -H hmc1 -P abc123

(The XCATROOT environment variable is set when xCAT is installed. The
default value is "/opt/xcat".)
