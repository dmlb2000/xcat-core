=head1 NAME

B<rmvm> - Removes HMC-, IVM-, KVM-, Vmware- and zVM-managed partitions or virtual machines.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

I<rmvm [-h| --help]>

I<rmvm [-v| --version]>


I<rmvm [-V| --verbose] noderange [-r] [--service]>

=head2 For KVM and Vmware:

I<rmvm [-p] [-f]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The rmvm command removes the partitions specified in noderange. If noderange is an CEC, all the partitions associated with that CEC will be removed. Note that removed partitions are automatically removed from the xCAT database. For IVM-managed systems, care must be taken to not remove the VIOS partition, or all the associated partitions will be removed as well.
