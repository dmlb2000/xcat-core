=head1 NAME

B<makeknownhosts> - Make a known_hosts file under $ROOTHOME/.ssh for input noderange.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<makeknownhosts> [I<noderange>]

B<makeknownhosts> {B<-h>|B<--help>}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<makeknownhosts> builds a known_hosts file in the $ROOTHOME/.ssh directory for all nodes from the input noderange. The known_hosts file is built from the 
shared ssh host key that xCAT distributes to the nodes. To build the key for a
node, you are only required to have the node in the database and name resolution
 working for the node. You do not have to be able to access the node. 
Having this file will avoid the ssh warning when nodes are automatically added to the known_hosts file.   Th file should be distributed using xdcp to all the nodes, if you want node to node communication not to display the warning.
