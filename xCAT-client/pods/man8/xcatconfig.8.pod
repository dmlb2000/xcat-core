=head1 NAME

B<xcatconfig> - Sets up the  Managment Node during the xCAT install.

=head1 SYNOPSIS


B<xcatconfig> 

B<xcatconfig> {B<-f>|B<--force>} 

B<xcatconfig> {B<-h>|B<--help>}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<xcatconfig> During the install of the Management Node, it will generate the .ssh keys for root and the ssh hostkeys that will be shared by the nodes. It will generate the certificates used by the daemon and initialize the site table, and start the xcatd. 
 
=head1 OPTIONS

=over 6

=item B<-f> I<force>

The force option may  be used after the install to reinitialize the Management Node. This will regenerate keys, credential and reinititialize the site table. This option should be used, if keys or credentials become corrupt or lost. 
Additional action must be taken after using the force options.  ssh keys must be redistributed to the nodes, site table attributes might need to be restored, makeconservercf needs to be stopped and started to pick up the new credentials, rspconfig needs to be rerun to distribute the new keys to the MM. 
A new set of common ssh host keys will have  been generated for the nodes. If you wish your nodes to be able to ssh to each other with out password intervention,  then you should redistribute these new keys to the nodes.  You can do this my reinstalling the nodes, or by xdcp /install/postscripts/hostkeys/*  to the /etc/ssh directory on all nodes.  If the nodes hostkeys are updated then you will need to remove their entries from the known_hosts files on the managment node before using ssh, xdsh, xdcp. 
For a service node,  it is probably best to re-install the service node to make sure the correct keys are picked up in the correct directory for node installs.
